# Sorting files

This is a script in python that sorts your files that contain a specific word or text from a folder, copying them into a new folder named by you and removing that specific word or text from the file name. 


## Features

- It can sort a huge number of files
- It works on any OS


## How to use in your CMD

```
python sorting.py files essays   
Everything is done.
```

files is the source folder, that means you have to write the folder's name where your files are.

essays is the target folder, it means is the folder where the files will be copied with the names changed (you just give the name, it will create the folder, like in the example from above with "essays").


## How it should look to work


```
Folder with the files
sorting.py
```
The folder from where you want to sort your files should be in the same directory as the sorting.py script.

## What it uses
- OS
- JSON
- SHUTIL
- SYS


## Lessons Learned

I made this project for learning how scripts work. This is my first script so I'll learn more along the way.
